**The server sends a large number of unnecessary usermessages to players/bots over the network. These messages can and should be hooked and prevented on the server before being sent.**
- Examples: Damage (every hit is being sent as a usermessage, but client doesnt need that info), Geiger, Rumble, Train, TextMsg ( only the part that channeling useless text to player consoles), and UpdateRadar, which currently sends full radar information to every player including other teams and entities(c4 for example) that are not visually visible. This data should be filtered on a per player basis and rate-limited to only what is relevant. Preventing or properly limiting these messages will noticeably improve players ping stability, connection quality, and overall network and frame performance when connected to the server.
